the 3D printers that belong to the club, their condition (working or broken), who are using them, and
develop a policy and a procedure on how students can use them and report issues.
* Dr. Lu will help Elijah and Lukas get key access to Taylor 206B (research lab 4 for 3D printing) so that other students can contact them to schedule a time to use the 3D printers.
* Everyone will try to make it to the club fair, which starts at 6:30pm (Thursday 9/15/22). Setup starts at 6:10pm on the Forum. Everyone will bring items they have made to showcase.
* Joel will try to contact Coleen to get her 
[EasyThread K1 3D printer](https://www.easythreed.com/h-col-1492.html) to display at the club fair for its "cute" factor.
* Dr. Lu will try to get a club banner designed by SBU marketing and printed by Thursday for the club fair.
* The club plans to attend a [Fix-It Fair](https://thelibrary.org/programs/)
in Midtown Carnegie Branch Library (upstairs meeting room, on 10/8/22 noon-4 p.m.) in Springfield. If it is feasible, the club could offer similar service to the campus community. This allows the club members to use their skills to benefit others.
